# Network
Network as a set of two or more endpoint devices that communicate with each other through a shared medium.

## Protocol 
 A set of rules or standards that have to be adhered to.
 
### Difference between internet,Internet and WWW
There is a subtle difference between an internet and the Internet. When spelled with a lowercase i, internet is derived from inter-network and refers to the connectivity between different networks. When capitalized, the Internet refers to the services that are publicly available outside of our own networks and the supporting infrastructure.

Let me clarify this with two examples. Company A's infrastructure connecting directly to company B's infrastructure would be classed as an inter-network. In this instance, the connections are not publicly available. However, when you connect to a web page such as Facebook or Hotmail, or to a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server, this is classed as the Internet as they are publicly available.

We have also come to treat the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW) as the same entity, whereas this is not the case. As we mentioned previously, the Internet refers to services and infrastructure. In contrast, the WWW is only a portion of the services that the Internet provides, albeit a large portion, and refers to servers that provide websites to end users.

## basic security technologies that we can utilize to protect our networks:

#### Firewalls
a firewall is designed to either allow or deny network traffic based upon a set of defined criteria. These criteria could be a predefined set of default rules or could be user-created, or even a combination of the two. These rules are often referred to as access control entries (ACEs), and a group of them form an access control list (ACL). These criteria could then be applied to outbound (or egress) traffic or inbound (or ingress) traffic. Understanding that a rule can be applied in each direction is important to know. For example, you may be troubleshooting a connectivity problem between two devices, so you would use the commonly used ICMP tool known as ping since ICMP can be used for malicious purposes and Windows Firewall blocks it by default.
